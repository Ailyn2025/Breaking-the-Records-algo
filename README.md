# Breaking-the-Records-algo
Breaking-the-Records This code solves the Breaking Records problem by counting how many times a basketball player breaks their highest and lowest scoring records throughout a season. The code tracks the maximum and minimum scores while iterating through all game scores, incrementing counters each time a new record high or record low is achieved.
